# MNIST

The current example expects the tf records to already be included on the local environment (these can be created by using the included [`.py` script](./make_records/convert_to_records.py)). After the tf records have been created. The current directory and config files should work as expected when calling `python yamlflow.py` with the config paths set correctly.

## NOTE

This directory is used as the development data for `softmax`
