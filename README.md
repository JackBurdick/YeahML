### note
project structure is currently non-existant and will be formed later + once a logical structure appears


### TODO:
- update tf_logs dir to be set on each run by a "name". include option to delete current logs as needed
- Add image augmentation logic
- dropout
- convert layer to lower API
- add scalar
- add graph to `tf_logs`
- include different metrics
- weight/bias regularization
